## Rationale behind this project
- Food protection and food safety is arguably one of the most important aspects to 
keeping the public safe and healthy. In fact, according to the World Health Organization, 
600 million people become ill from contaminated food and around 420,000 people die 
every year. We believe that the true information problem is that people do not have an 
easily accessible and intuitive way to determine if the places they go to are compliant 
with food inspections. With this in mind, we hope to solve this information problem by 
creating a web application where users could be recommended locations that have a 
good inspection track record, while also warning the users of nearby locations with 
violations.  

## About the Data 
 - We are using the Food Inspection dataset available on the [Prince Georgeâ€™s 
County Data Portal](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Health/Food-Inspection/umjn-t2iz). This dataset includes information on whether or not a restaurant 
has failed inspection and how many times as inspection are done every six months.
