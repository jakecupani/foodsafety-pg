# _Prince George's County Food Inspections_
> An application created to help users make make informed, healthy decisions regarding where to eat around PG County

*According to the World Health Organization, 600 million people become ill from contaminated food and around 420 thousand people die from contaminated food every year. Given these statistics, food safety and handling of restaurants is arguably one of the most direct ways in keeping the public healthy.*

*However, the issue stems not only in the lack of cleanliness while preparing food, but the lack of knowledge consumers have while picking places to eat. This lack of access to an easily accessible and intuitive way to determine if the places people go to eat are compliant with food inspection standards is what led to the creation of the "Prince George's County Food Inspections" application. It's goal is to bring to light the true state of the food establishments to help people make informed decisions about where they go to eat.*

## Browsers
Our application was created with all browsers in mind.

All modern browsers will be able to host our web-based application, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari. 

With the growing use of hand-held mobile devices, we created our application with this in mind, paying special attention to the resolution and interactivity of its display. With that being said, our application seemlessly views on either desktop computers or hand-held devices, in order to make wherever a user views the application easy to use. 

In addition, the OS your device is running does not interfere with the ability for the app to preform well because the application has been created with both operating systems in mind.
