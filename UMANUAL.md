**<a name="intro"></a>Introduction**
<p> Welcome!

This user manual was created in order to help your experience with the Food Safety PG application be as easy and seamless as possible. We understand that using new applications can be intimidating especially if they present the information in a new way; that’s where we hope this manual helps ease the transition.
</p>

**<a name="fspg"></a>What is FSPG**
<p> Good question.

Food Safety PG, or FSPG for short, is an application that was created in order to guide the general public, and even other groups such as health care administrators and restaurant owners, on the reality that food establishments across PG County are in, and whether that reality is good or bad.

Hundreds of millions of people are being contaminated by restaurants that are not properly preparing food, causing illnesses and sometimes death, all because there is no clear way for people to know which places are safe to eat in. FSPG is here to change that. 

FSPG is an interactive application that allows users to explore the different food establishments around the area and learn more about their cleanliness rating and how well they did in previous inspections. Because of its transparent and unbiased presentation of the data, users will be able to make more well-informed decisions on where to eat, making sure their health is their number one priority.

**<a name="nav"></a>FSPG Navigation**
<p> Getting started…

When you first load the application you’re brought to the Home page. 

There are three other pages, the About page, the Documentation page, and the Contact Us page.

The Home page is where most of your time will be spent, it’s the actual application we’ve created to make your life easier! On this page you’ll be able to filter for different food establishments, read more about their ratings, and navigate to other restaurants. All in hopes that you’ll be able to pick out safer food establishments to eat from the next time you go out. 
The About page explains our motivation for creating this application, and sheds light on the hands that put it together. 
The Documentation page cites sources that were used while creating the application. 
The Contact Us page allows users to send their thoughts and feedback, as well as any questions they may have regarding the application. 
</p>

<p> Here are some tips to help using our application more efficient for you!

- If you aren’t sure which type of establishment you want to look up, you can click “load all data”. This will pull up all the markers on the map for you to click through whatever you want.
**WARNING**: this will most likely make your computer run slow so this option is usually used as a last resort

- To learn more information about the inspection results, click “See detailed inspection results”, which gives a detailed breakdown of the inspection.

- The ‘Reset’ button deletes all the markers from the map, allowing you to start your search over again.

- If you wanted directions, or to see how far to the food establishment you have selected if from you, you can click the Google Maps icon located under the ‘Location’ section. This will pull up Google Maps in a separate tab. 

- Green results are in compliance, while red results are out of compliance.

**<a name="doc"></a>Documentation Page**
<p> The Documentation page is the third button on the global navigation bar at the top of the application. 

The Documentation page hosts a brief description on how to work through the website, as well as a link to the data source that ignited our initial thoughts regarding this project, as well as what we based the entire project off of. 

Being able to access the dataset we created our application with is useful to see what other information we had at our reach
